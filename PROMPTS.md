Let's start implementation! Take me step by step on how I would do this - remember that we must incorporate all the points I mentioned regarding the LLM model, workflow / coordination, user input via voice, and memory/state

Going back to the implementation, right now, when I run the code, I see the UI, but the audio isn't processed. How do we actually integrate the LLM model type into this?

Is this really the best way to go about things? Please reason about this through a pros and cons list in terms of scalability,
code cleanliness, and complexity.

Please explain DurableWorkers to me like I'm a 5 year old.
