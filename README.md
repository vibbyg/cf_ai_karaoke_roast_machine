https://karaoke-roast-machine.vibgofficial.workers.dev/

This project submission for CloudFlare's SWE Internship opening allows you to sing any song into the microphone, and 
the AI model will roast your singing skills with witty remarks. You can dial up the heat as you like, and past/new

remembers this and roasts you on it.

It looks something like this:
